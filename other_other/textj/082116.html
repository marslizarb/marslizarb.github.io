    <p>Vaccumed the car. Pretended to be an adult but avoided literally all my duties. Went to the arboretum with Brian for an hour (and caught quite a few pokemon, though none rare) then came back. Took a nap. Ate dinner and FaceTimed with the family. We are a computer family, our souls constantly toppling over without a stand or being muted or intentionally hung up on. Each person in a different place and in a different piece of Apple technology. The future is now.</p>
    <p>I have a nagging fear that I may not graduate this upcoming semester for some idiotic reason or another. Regardless of whether or not I graduate this semester, I will be moving to New York (or NEW JERSEY, whatever). I will finish my final project, my senior "film," and move on, waltzing straight through bureaucratic tape and into the youthful unknown.</p>
    <p>Brian came over and we watched "Fantastic Mr. Fox." I hate myself for saying this, but that which I so despise in others — feigned quirkiness, uniqueness, strength of personality, intentionally choosing two different colored socks, all fake and fashioned for the viewer — I truly love when done well and sincerely. Wes Anderson is god. (Brian didn't like it as much.)</p>
    <p>We also looked up what it means to be boring, because we are learning how to deal with boring people. Boring people are very boring regardless of circumstance — indeed, it's about the person and their humor and storytelling ability — and I strive to be not boring. This paragraph, though, is boring.</p>
    <P>Later in the night, I found an 11-year-old on YouTube. She is very smart and very crass. I wish I had some record of who I was when I was 11. I wish I was free to be a human when I was 11. This is why I need to go to New York.</P>
