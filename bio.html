                <h4>Who are you and what do you do?</h4>
                <h5>I'm Marcie. I'm 22, and I work in New York as a freelance animator and illustrator. I also make games and websites (both infrequently and not very well). Sometimes I like to write and do photography.</h5>

            <li>
                <h4>What do you want to do?</h4>
                <h5>I want to be an independent animator/filmmaker. But I also really like working with people. A tough nut to crack. I'll figure it out someday. <i>~The world is my oyster!~</i></h5>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>What’s your background?</h4>
                <h5>I graduated in December 2016 with a BFA from the Minneapolis College of Art and Design where I studied animation for two and a half years. Prior to that, I studied psychology at UCLA for 2 years. I moved to the east coast a few months after graduating. I grew up in a suburb of Minneapolis, but I was born in Vancouver, Canada. My mom is Chinese and my dad is French Canadian. I also have a brother. He's the only person who likes my tweets.</h5>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>What themes do you pursue?</h4>
                <h5>I prefer forming a story prior to expressing a theme. But things that tend to pop up over and over again: absurd humor, bright colors, existential loneliness, fun/obscure music, relationships, the weirdness of people.</h5>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Where do you want to be in 4 years?</h4>
                <h5>Gainfully employed, living in New York City, with a few short films under my belt, not dead.</h5>

                <h5>I watch a lot of TV, movies, and short films. Podcasts are my entertainment bread and butter. I like reading graphic novels and regular novels (but a little bit less, since I have a short attention span). I try to draw or paint in my sketchbook every day. I also like to cook and eat, especially freshly baked bread. Sometimes I play music (piano, melodica, ukulele). Recently, I've taken up embroidery. But despite all these wildly interesting hobbies, most of my time is <i>actually</i> spent on the Internet, mindlessly sifting through YouTube or Reddit.</h5>
