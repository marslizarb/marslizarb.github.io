This is my personal website that I created in an attempt to teach myself basic html and css. I'd like to think that this website "alive" in the sense that it's constantly being updated, redesigned, rewritten, etc., so check back frequently (and explore all paths of the labyrinth!).

And if you have any comments or suggestions (all of which are greatly appreciated), don't hesitate to send me an email.
