<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Cultivating Chaos: why your art depends on the unplanned</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- first i’ll go over my work, and how i got to where i am today</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- then, i’ll go over my guiding philosophy</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- but first:</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Thporth! - 1 minute</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">- this is called Thporth!</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">- i made my first summer at school</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Who am I?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marcie LaCerte</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- I’m from Minnesota, went to the Minneapolis College of Art and Design. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- I live and work in NYC as a motion graphics animator and video producer</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- but i moonlight as an <b>experimental artist</b>—i’ve dabbled with websites, games, sketchbooks, and improv</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My life’s work, in three phases</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">phase one: DISCOVERING MYSELF IN SCHOOL</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- i wanted to go to art school to study illustration, but i quickly moved into animation after watching a lot of experimental indie films on vimeo</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- at school, my <b>attention was divided between experimentation and narrative structure</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">here are some embarrassing things i made in school</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">THE LITTLE SHIPS, 2015 - 2 minutes?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- this is an abstract experimental animation, set to a song by jean-jacques perrey. it was inspired by the visual music animations of oskar fischinger.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">HUBERT MILFORD, 2015 - 2 minutes</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- this was my stop motion final and the first film i ever storyboarded. it’s unfinished, however, since i was never able to figure out the ending</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">AN AFTERNOON RIPPLING, 2016 - gifs, 1 minute</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- this is my graduation project</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- it’s a 2d click-and-point game that <b>combines animation, illustration, and written dialogue</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- it’s the first time i successfully <b>united traditional storytelling with experimentation</b></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- i graduated with this project <b>ALSO unfinished</b>, because, i literally had to learn how to program in unity. however…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">LITERALLY LAST WEEKEND, I FINALLY FINISHED THE ENTIRE GAME. So i just want to say that IT’S OK TO FINISH PROJECTS YEARS AFTER YOU PROMISED ALL YOUR FRIENDS THAT YOU’D FINISH</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">phase two: UNEMPLOYMENT</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- after graduating i moved from minnesota to the great state of new jersey</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- i was suddenly thrust into the world of freelancing for pennies. and i had to make art that wasn’t just for myself, but for CLIENTS</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- my mom gave me some advice then. she said that i should learn coding, because that’s how people make money</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- little did she know that i was already into coding—just not the kind that was employable</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SOCIAL MEDIA BIO GENERATOR, 2016 - 1 minute</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- this is a generator of social media biographies</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- it was a parody i made in my free time for fun and to learn coding basics</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">MARSLIZARD.NET, 2016 — 1 minute</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- this is my personal website. a lot of people were like, i don’t know about this, it’s not a good portfolio— but…if an employer can’t handle me at my WORST, then they don’t deserve me at me BEST!!!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- also i made this in 2016 and it basically looks the same today because i mostly forgot how to code</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">THE SCHOOL OF LIFE, 2017-2018—show gifs? - 1 minute</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- i made two films for The School of Life, which is a youtube channel of animations set to long philosophical monologues by this british guy ALAIN DE BOTTON.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- this client also paid pennies - relative to the amount of time it took to finish, since these videos are 5-7 minutes long - but they were great opportunities to practice and experiment</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SUMMER OF LOVE, 2017—show full - 3 minutes?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- when i was in school, i had this idea that i would work full time by day, and by night, i would be an indie animator</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- little did i know that after graduating i would actually just have a lot of time and very little motivation and money</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- but after months of restlessness and sketch-booking  i managed to cross something off my bucket list and make an independent short film</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- it was lightning in a bottle. the idea —and script— was generated in a single night, and it only took 2 weeks to finish.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- its success was unexpected, but it helped jumpstart my career, kind of</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">phase three: AM I A JOURNALIST? KIND OF</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- so i landed an animation internship at NPR—how? my manager liked my WEIRD WEBSITE</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- i taught myself motion graphics on the job, basically. i mostly worked on videos for NPR’s youtube channel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- but i also did some illustration and design. i even acted in a video, but i’m not going to play that</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">my manager was cool enough to give me almost full creative freedom over one project:</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">THE MARSHMALLOW TEST, 2018 — 3 minutes</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- this is a mixed media stop motion animation for the psychology podcast Invisibilia</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- i spent a lot of time painting at my desk and buying/eating marshmallows</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- it was fun to make and i learned a lot about nonfiction storytelling</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- after npr, i landed a full-time contract gig at Quartz, which is another media company</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- i honed my motion graphics skills even further at this job, and my animation output went from primarily hand-drawn to primarily collage-y. this was mostly to accommodate for the time crunch, since i had to make around two minutes - of explainers every week. and collage is also kind of trendy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- but whenever possible, i tried to insert some of my own weirdness into my motion graphics.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- while i was working at NPR and Quartz, i started getting more interested in explainer videos. which are basically video essays about newsy things. so…i made this. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">SHREK, 2018 — show until 4:35</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- this is an 8-minute long documentary about shrek, but i’m only going to play half</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- just want to clarify that NOBODY asked for it. nobody wanted it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- the only reason it exists is because i had a supervisor who trusted me enough to helped me write and edit this video, even though i had no prior video-making experience</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- i will never make anything as good as this so this presentation is downhill from here</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">KIDS ON YOUTUBE (2018) — show until 1:25</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- i co-produced this “proper” documentary about the perils of kids content on youtube—i pitched the idea, did the interviews, wrote the outline, and did most of the animation</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- so, almost a journalist?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- it’s 10 minutes long, so i’m just going to play the introduction</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- at this point, i wanted to expand my journalism skills, and establish myself at quartz as a <b>video producer</b> with an animation background.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- to that end, i pitched a wrote a few articles</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- i wrote a newsletter about bricks, one about tik tok, and an article about the Fyre Fest documentaries</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- I was trying to legitimize myself in the eyes of my coworkers and manager</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- but all my ideas were about internet culture—which basically means memes, but longer</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- also i don't have a degree in journalism so it kind of makes sense that i was never able to break through my role as “weird artist troll in the corner”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">GEOCITIES (2019)— show until 4:56</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- i finished this about a month ago. it’s the last thing i made at quartz and it’s an explainer about the early internet - and the importance of preserving it</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- i produced this with a friend, since we were both interested in the origins of internet culture</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- this is about 9 minutes long so i’m going to play a little more than half</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CONCLUSION ON MY LIFE’S WORK</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- i’ll probably keep making art about the internet, on the internet</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- almost everything i get paid to do was self-taught after school</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- the best things i’ve made were fostered by an elder who trusted me and gave me structure. this is true both in school and out</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- even if i work really really hard at something, if people think your subject matter is silly, they won’t respect me for my time or creativity</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- as a result, there is a perpetual push-and-pull between my desire to be irreverent and absurd, and to make work that is “respectable” and conforming</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">- in other words, chaos and order</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">QUESTIONS?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">5 MINUTE INTERLUDE—there is a bag with collage elements. gather whatever images speak to you. maximum 30. if you like only a part of it, that’s ok, i have scissors</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">ON CULTIVATING CHAOS</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">THE MUPPET THEORY OF CHAOS</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- In 2012, Dalia Lithwick published an article in Slate where she postulated a theory of human behavior.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- Her thesis was that in our world, there is a dialectic between two types of people—order muppets and chaos muppets.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">[CLICK]</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- Order muppets are neurotic, regimented, and averse to surprises. "They resent the responsibility of the world weighing on their shoulders.” That’s Bert.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- Chaos puppets are emotional, volatile, warm, fuzzy. "They make their way through life in a swirling maelstrom of food crumbs, small flaming objects, and the letter C.” That’s Ernie.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- To find out what you are, look at your long-term relationships and collaborative partners. If your partner is an Order Muppet, you are likely Chaos, and vice versa.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">LET’S TALK ABOUT CHAOS: What is chaos in art?</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">it is not mania or anarchy — though if you’re naturally inclined towards any of those things you’re probably a chaotic muppet</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">it is absurdity — a truthful randomness</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">it’s the feeling of being drunk on creativity</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">it’s subconscious influence, the id</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">it’s collages and sketchbooks and mood boards</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">it’s making intentionally ugly art</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">it’s made up words by teenagers — yeet, scrappy</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">it’s the feeling of losing your keys inside your house</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">it’s the internet—good and bad parts</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">examples</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">paul mccartney, geocities, yellow submarine the movie, the carousel scene from strangers on a train, the actress gong li, daisies, longform improv, oskar kokoshka, the priest from fleabag, the book priestdaddy, florine stettheimer, curb your enthusiasm, truffaut's character antoine doinel, nina simone, st. vincent, william blake, the song dionysus by international boyband sensation bts, the artist lynda barry, and the youtuber contrapoints</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">This presentation is heavily chaos-biased, but I don’t want to imply that order doesn’t have its place in art. In fact...</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">NO CHAOS WITHOUT ORDER</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- Let me give you an example.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- Susan Sontag’s seminal essay “Notes On Camp” is a collection of vignettes that aim to describe the sensibility of camp</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- (it’s a fun essay, i recommend reading it)</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- But let’s talk about how she delivers her message. her writing is articulate. dense. she divides her paragraphs numerically. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">[CLICK]</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- but her subject matter, “camp”, is playful, weird, outrageous, fun.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- in other words, the formality of “notes on camp" contradicts its content. yet her structure is precisely WHY people understand camp, and why her essay is THE essay on camp.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- this tension, between structure and content, reminds me in a lot of ways of something else that artists are familiar with: mood boards </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i make all of my mood boards on this website called are.na.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- it’s way better than pinterest because you can have pictures, videos, writing, gifs—it’s multimedia</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i make mood boards for basically all my projects—usually for work or freelance</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- but i also have mood boards for as-of-yet-unresolved ideas for future projects</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- this is something i call [fever dream]</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- not sure what it is yet. but it might be something one day.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i think mood boards are an INTELLIGIBLE chaos. i start with feverish image-gathering, framed impulsively around a vague theme. and then, i cull through the content, picking away at cliches and assumptions, smooshing together unlike things, until i come away with a collection that feels both inspirational and original </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">IN PURSUIT OF A DEEPER CHAOS</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- when i was younger, i didn’t think i was capable of being an artist. i loved art, and i loved art class, but i could never draw on my own. i didn’t feel creative when i drew—i could only draw from pictures, or with a grid.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i think as artists we crave beauty. so we have high expectations for it. which can make our own art-making very difficult.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i wasn’t able to break free of these expectations until AFTER college, when i started keeping sketchbooks.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">SKETCHBOOK C</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- this was the first sketchbook i kept after school. i started out by drawing from pictures</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- but since it was summer, and since i was unemployed, i started going outside and drawing from life a lot</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i listened to podcasts while drawing, which helped occupy that judgmental part of my brain. so the drawings started coming from a more subconscious place</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- that helped loosen me up but i still couldn’t really conjure anything from my imagination. when i did, it felt stiff, or artificial</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">SKETCHBOOK B</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i was employed when i started this sketchbook. my commute was an hour each way, so i had a lot of time to draw. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i think trains are the best place to draw. there are a lot of very still people, and the constant movement of a train really stimulates my brain in a productive way.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- you don’t even have to like the train that you're on. my train of choice was also the literal bane of my existence: new jersey transit. (this is a joke for the new yorkers)</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- by drawing in sketchbooks pretty consistently for about a year, i started getting these mystical inclinations towards art and creativity</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- there was this one time when i was drawing on about two or three hours of sleep. i was barely a person. but my drawings……….they were some of the best drawings i’ve EVER done. to this day. they were weird and swirly and completely from my imagination</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- (forgot to scan them so you’ll just have to imagine something like this, but better)</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i started becoming less and less interested in drawing people from life, and more interested in composing quasi-religious compositions, drawings of figures in a spiritual ecstasy. it’s also where i came up with this “chaos” philosophy that i’m presenting right now</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- this was weird to me because i’ve never been religious, or even spiritual</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- what’s up with that? is this #relatable? anyway:</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">SKETCHBOOK A</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- this is my latest sketchbook. it’s mostly collage</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- these collages are very intuitive — it takes a lot of time to cut up the pictures, but it takes no time to paste them onto the page</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i’ve collected old photos since high school for the PURPOSE of eventually collaging them, but i’ve only recently really dug my hands into my collection</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- these collages take shape based mostly on instinct—i look for unique compositions, funny juxtapositions, and colors. ultimately, i trust my gut.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- the more i work in sketchbooks, the deeper i feel that subconscious influence has a far larger part to play in creativity than almost anything else.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- collage is one way to get at the subconscious. another way…</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">FREE WRITING</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- in the artist’s way, julia cameron came up with an iconic free writing exercise called “morning pages” — you’re suppose to fill up three pages, front and back, by hand, with stream-of-consciousness writing, first thing in the morning.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i’ve only done this a few times because i hate waking up early. but i like incorporating writing into my mood boards</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- for example: [show an afternoon rippling script] — </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- this is my mood board for an afternoon rippling. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- it started as pictures.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- but since this project was a STORY, i also needed to write an outline</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- that outline started as stream-of-consciousness brainstorming. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- the final project isn’t a lot like what i had planned here. but that’s ok. since i literally worked on this game for YEARS, it was incredibly helpful to go back and see what i was thinking at the start, and recapture my original, much angstier feelings</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">IMPROV</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- but one of the best ways of channeling your inner chaos is through the ART of THEATER: specifically IMPROV</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">[click]</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i took my improv class at UCB. it’s an iconic theater so i had high expectations</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i literally had my class performance last weekend so it’s VERY fresh</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- some thoughts on improv:</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">[click]</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i’m pretty bad at it right now which i was NOT expecting, and it’s very humbling</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- it’s better to be cringey and commit to a scene than to be ironically detached. i think this is like finishing a bad drawing instead of ironically X-ing it out</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- we did exercises in class where we literally just had a conversation with another person, but on a stage. because that’s basically what improv is: being a person on a stage</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- this is a pretty famous improv thing. for those who don’t know, a fundamental tenet of improv is to respond to your scene partner with “yes, and”, not “no, but.” my main takeaway from this is that improv is basically not only being a creative person with good and funny ideas, but ALSO trusting that the OTHER person is a creative person with good ideas</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1">i’m paul! - 1 minute</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- since i don’t have any improv to show you i will show you something that i made in one night with my boyfriend</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- he improvised it but i made the video so my name is ultimately the one that gets credit</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- to recap what i’ve talked about so far: chaos is a state of being that every creative person should utilize in their own work.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- in MY work, i am trying to approximate this feeling of bridled mania. of something unhinged boiling beneath an intelligible surface. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i have not yet attained this chaotic ideal. i’m saying it out loud right now in a karmic attempt to self-actualize it. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- but this is just MY goal, informed by art that i love.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">[click]</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- but YOU should also care about chaos.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- here are TWO reasons why.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">YOUR GUT</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i have a lot of friends who are artists or who work in creative jobs, and when we critique each other's work, i often hear from them: “oh, i was thinking about changing that, but i wasn’t sure if i should.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- not to knock on my friends—but i think this type of attitude is ultimately detrimental.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- if we don’t trust our own gut instincts, then what are we relying on to make decisions?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i think the answer to that is we are relying on what we think we SHOULD do.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- for example, at work, i might gravitate towards colors like pink and orange and turquoise, but i know that i SHOULD stick with something more palatable in journalistic animation, like greys and blues.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- in my own work, i try not to let that “should” knowledge affect my art. i do what i feel like i want to do. and i do it decisively.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">[click]</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- when i was in school, i had a really great teacher who told me that i had good instincts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i don’t think my instincts are necessarily better or worse than anyone else’s—but i do think that i trust my instincts more than a lot of people.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- and i think i do that, because i really believe that instincts are the foundation of our inner creative worlds. instincts are what make our art both unique and relatable.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">[click]</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- instincts can be fostered intentionally, by exercises like free writing and sketching and making mood boards. but it’s just as important, i think, to ingest content—because the more you know about the world, the more you’re able to build on it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i watch a lot of movies and read a lot of essays and listen to a lot of podcasts not just for inspiration, but to stow these stories away in my subconscious. so that when i am creating my own art, my gut instincts will be stronger and more decisive.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- the adage of “learning the rules before breaking them”—i’m kind of advocating for that, but for the part of your brain that lies dormant.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">here is a depiction of my subconscious. not really. but it’s dreamy and floaty in the way that i think all our subconsciouses are. i call it “the cluster.” it’s where i digitally organize all my notes, loose ideas, processes, and intentionally bad artwork, like “i’m paul!”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">as much as i’d like to say that by fostering my subconscious, i can pump out the world's most beautiful and unique and inspiring art on the reg, i can’t. most of my output is pretty bad, objectively.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">but, if there’s one thing that i want you take from this presentation, it’s that the MAGIC is in the UNPLANNED.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">[click]</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">THE MAGIC IS IN THE UNPLANNED</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">[click]</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- here’s what i mean by that. in my improv class, our scenes were based on monologues that were inspired by audience prompts. these monologues weren’t MEANT to be hilarious—they were like funny little stories that you’d tell a friend or on a date.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- most of the time, the scenes that bloomed from these monologues were plucked from the CORE of the story. so if the monologue happened in a grocery store with a clerk, the set up for the first scene would usually also be set in a grocery store with a clerk.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- but the moments we laughed the hardest were in the moments where we felt surprise. which isn’t to say randomness—that comes naturally in improv—but in <b>surprise that felt truthful</b>. which is the absurd.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">[click]</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- a lot of improv beginners will try to plan their scenes and characters from the get-go. i do this, too. it’s really hard not to, because it’s scary to be thrust into the unknown, especially when that unknown is on a stage under a spotlight in front of people.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- but the moments i got the hardest laughs—or when i FELT the most “in the zone”—were when my lines or actions were unplanned. when i was reacting to the other person or situation in a truthful way. in improv, this is called “top of your intelligence"</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- this is when improv is at its best—when the actors on stage aren’t actors on a stage. they're people.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">[click]</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- here’s another example. In Aristotle’s Poetics, he writes about what makes a successful tragedy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">[click]</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">He says that the stories that induce the most fear and pity are produced by “incidents which, though unexpected, are seen to be no mere accident but the inevitable result of what has gone before.”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">[click]</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- In other words, the best endings are the ones that are both surprising and inevitable.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">[click]</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- Most of what we do is in service of the inevitable. Writers write outlines so that they know where their story—or presentation—is going. Artists make mood boards and sketches and character designs so they can know what their art will look like. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- But the best part of any project is when our brains react to our own plans, and say, “fuck that.” because that’s where the truth of the human experience is—not in anything we can predict or plan for. it’s in the chaos.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">ACTIVITY</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- with chaos and collaboration in mind, i’d like you guys to do this exercise</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- you have images in front of you. here is a sheet of paper with two halves. take those images and start collaging.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- trust your instincts. be playful. have fun.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- feel free to create two separate collages or one that spans the page. but know that it WILL be folded.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- i’m going to play a very good podcast for you while you work on this</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- there is a swear word so be warned</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- you have 10 minutes</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">(stop at 11:50)</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- ok STOP what you’re doing. </span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- glue down the last things that need to be glued down.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- now fold your papers in half, so that you can’t see the collage.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- write your name on the back in pencil.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- get up</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- trade your sheet of paper with someone else</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- NO PEEKING</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- when you get a new collage, write your name in pencil on the back</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- then, finish the collage with your images</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- again, have fun, be playful, and don’t worry about steamrolling, or being precious with other person’s collage</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- treat it as if you are receiving RAW materials with which you can transform in ANY way</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- and in the back of your head, try to figure out WHAT principle you are being guided by while collaging—what your theme might be, or what you notice when something “clicks” on the page</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">- you have 10 minutes to finish</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">(finish podcast)</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">now let’s go around the room an briefly present! </span></p>
