<p>Today I got my wisdom teeth taken out. When I went into surgery, I was initially very scared, and it felt surreal to have an IV in my arm and a gask mask over my face and two doctors at either side telling me that I was "doing great" and that I should "relax." Five minutes later, I found myself in my living room, draped in bath towels and towlettes and cloth-covered ice bags that I mistook for towelettes and unwittingly drooled blood all over.</p>
    
<p>I finished the last half of <i>The Minions</i> and watched <i>The Godfather</i> and a Shane Dawson YouTube video where he made a cake out of burgers. I think I also watched some "Rick and Morty," but I'm honestly not sure. Brian lovingly cared for me and helped remove bloody gauze from my mouth (he spent the <i>entire</i> day here!). Dad also went back to Colorado today, but I was not lucid enough to give him a proper goodbye, unfortunately.</p>
    
<p>In between the two films, I nearly overdosed on acetaminophen and spent half an hour wrapped in a bath towel, hallucinating on my brother's bed. Later, I nearly cried at the dinner table while eating mashed potatoes because I was so mad at my mom for almost killing me because she was irrationally opposed to giving me ibuprofen. Earlier, when I awoke from my anesthetized slumber, I apparently asked the doctors for my teeth, to which they replied that they had already thrown them away (allegedly). That was really the only funny-ish thing I said. I greeted Brian, when he came to my house, with a swollen face and a request for him to take an IQ test with me.</p>
    
<p>All in all, it was a good time.</p>

<p>I don't remember sending any of these messages. Except the one about mashed potatoes. Also, this is a group chat with Brian and my mom and I apparently openly talked about having whiskey (which I do have, actually. Very cool, I know).</p>

<p>I have no recollection of this.</p>
