<h1>In Love With Windex</h1>
Well, first, our tender, tightly-wound<br>
young Jean picked, sweetly, from the ground<br>
the detritus remaining from<br>
a prior unplanned dayâ€”and then,<br>
his rugged hands, incarnadine,<br>
traversed the bedroom, then the hearth,<br>
in search of buried history<br>
to pluck right from the earthâ€”and then<br>
our Jean, whose palpitating heart<br>
was managed by a steady<br>
one, two, three, four,<br>
ten, nine, eightâ€”then<br>
he took a sponge, then wet the sponge,<br>
then scrubbed the trails inscribed by her,<br>
by Julia, the one and only,<br>
who had disregarded what<br>
young Jean had then considered holy: <br>
ritualistic cleansing of the<br>
water-rings and particles<br>
of dust, now rampant, wildâ€”and then<br>
he thoughtfully looked at his work,<br>
his kitchen, clean and incandescent,<br>
glowing, bronze, the patina<br>
a stringent lapis-lazuli.<br><br>
Jean recollects his thoughts<br>
    <span style="float:right">and bites an apricot.</span><br>
<i>I find it hard to see<br></i>
    <span style="float:right">at first, our greying, tightly-wound, </span>
<i>the faintest memory<br></i>
    <span style="float:right">old Jean picks, slowly, from the ground </span>
<i>of what we used to beâ€”<br></i>
    <span style="float:right">the detritus remaining from </span>
<i>do you remember of <br></i>
    <span style="float:right">a prior thoughtless nightâ€”and then, </span>
<i>the night we spent above <br></i>
    <span style="float:right">his freckled hands, exsanguinous, </span>
<i>the estuary cove?â€”</i><br>
    <span style="float:right">traverse the kitchen, then the hearth,</span>
<i>the monastery roof?â€”<br></i>
    <span style="float:right">in search of buried history</span>
<i>your look was royal blue,<br></i>
    <span style="float:right">to pluck right from the earthâ€”and then </span>
<i>but if I only knew<br></i>
    <span style="float:right">our Jean, whose palpitating heart</span>
<i>of my receding view,<br></i>
    <span style="float:right">is managed by a steady </span>
<i>I would have followed you<br></i>
    <span style="float:right">one, two, three, four,</span>
<i>in the light,<br></i>
    <span style="float:right">ten, nine, eightâ€”then</span>
<i>into nightâ€”<br></i>
    <span style="float:right">he takes a sponge, then wets the sponge, </span>
<i>the last that I had heard<br></i>
    <span style="float:right">then scrubs the trails inscribed by her, </span>
<i>of you, the final word<br></i>
    <span style="float:right">the never to be spoken of, </span>
<i>of you, I overheard<br></i>
    <span style="float:right">now purged and oxidized by age </span>
<i>that what had faded fast <br></i>
    <span style="float:right">and tarnished pallid green by timeâ€” </span>
<i>from you was not the past, <br></i>
    <span style="float:right">and then he takes to consider </span>
<i>was nothing truly vast; <br></i>
    <span style="float:right">his bedroom, chaste, immaculate,</span>
<i>instead, the hourglassâ€” <br></i>
    <span style="float:right">the stainless steel corroded by </span>
<i>we were not meant to last</i><br>
    <span style="float:right">a caustic lapis-lazuli.</span>
