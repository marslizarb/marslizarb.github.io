<h1>Insomnia</h1>
    
In darkness, we are welcomed into sleep.<br>
As moonlight pools, we seal our eyes from light, <br>
embracing the unfathomable deep.<br><br>
    
In bluish nocturnes dwell our dreams. They keep <br>
alive eternal day, keep life alight.<br>
In darkness, we are welcomed into sleep.<br><br>

Our nightly visions form a life complete, <br>
but often emptiness disturbs respite. <br>
We may fear the unfathomable deep.<br><br>
    
The blazing, blushing sun makes living sweet; <br>
it banishes the void, devoid of light.<br>
In darkness, thus, I find it hard to sleep.<br><br>
    
I lie awake, am swallowed whole by bleak <br>
black-blue. And while I do not fear the night, <br>
I dread, dread the unfathomable deep.<br><br>
    
Below the blue, ablaze from head to feet, <br>
I dwell on a neglected life, despite<br>
the waning light. I fight the urge to sleep, <br>
to cede to the unfathomable deep.
