<h1>two women i dreamt of last week</h1>

<h3><u>the first</u></h3>
When she was 13, she cut off her waist-length hair to donate to children with cancer. Her hair had been growing for years and felt substantial in her lap, separated from her head, coiled thickly like a rope. She was left with a bob and considered herself neither a better nor worse personâ€”her charity was instinctual.<br><br>

From a three-quarter angle and with a neutral expression, she looked classically elegant, with high cheekbones and wide green eyes and dark, tapered brows. Her nose was uncharacteristically prominent, though, with a small bump at the bridge, providing a masculine aspect to an otherwise lovely, forgettable face. This gift she received from her Persian-Jewish mother. She had a pronounced philtrum and sharply tapered cupid's bow that revealed, when smiling, a brilliantly white set of gaped front teethâ€”this was inherited from her father. Though wealthy, she was never interested in braces; she cared little in how she looked, so long as her hair was out of her eyes and her legs were unbound by cloth.<br><br>

She'd traveled to twenty countries by the time she turned 15, and in each country, she bought a dress and a book. Like a less vehement Savonarola, she too hated the philosophical implications of materialism and vanityâ€”it contrasted with her philanthropic nature. But she didn't consider the dresses souvenirs or pretty little things; they were instead indelible vessels for memories, symbols of her narrative; they were exceptional. (She also kept a journal so as to not forget, to make tangible her soul.) She limited herself in other thingsâ€”only purchasing practical, durable shoes; only wearing inherited jewelry; only buying, no matter how musty or mysterious, books written in a language she could read. She bought dresses that were culturally significant and comfortable enough to run around in. She preferred silk or muslinâ€”singularly coloredâ€”and fitted bodices, a-line silhouettes, swirling arabesques, thin straps tied loosely around her waist or neck. She was short, so she liked long dressesâ€”billowing fabric made her feel as grand and revered as a slender Corinthian column. Her favorite dress was from Suzhou, and it was dyed a deep blueâ€”so deep, in fact, that cleaning required hand-washing in saltwater, lest the brilliant indigo bleed, then fade.<br><br>

By 17 she'd gained weight in her hips and breasts and could no longer wear the summer dresses she bought in Rome or Lisbonâ€”nostalgic, she would dip into her wardrobe, flipping through fabrics like diary pages, warmly recalling breezy days of bralessness. By 21 she thoroughly filled out, her biology settling on a petite, womanly form. She hadn't travelled since she started university, and the dresses of her youth hung limply in the dark, relics of halcyon days.<br><br>

<h3><u>the second</u></h3>
She speaks fluent Russian. Her hair is thin and light, and easily holds a curl. She didn't start wearing makeup until she was 19, and even still it's only eyeliner, mascara, and tinted lip balm. Her cheeks are plump and rosy and smooth, with pale freckles and fading acne marks stippled across the bridge of her nose (and some on her forehead). In a graceful feminine curve, her nose slopes upwards, and her mouth and jaw protrude past her forehead, creating a pout in profile. Her shoulders and wrists and neck are small, but her thighs are thick and hips ampleâ€”her bottom half perpetually lags behind her torso. She has only a few articles of clothing in her wardrobe, and most are thrifted or hand-me-downs from her mother and cousinsâ€”brown or grey or blue-black cottons. (In the back of her closet is a sack of neon-colored polo shirts and alt rock tees from her early adolescence.) Her jewelry and shoe collections, however, are glamorous and elegant and vast. Pieces dangle or shine or both; all are well-maintained. Her favorite (and least worn) is a pair of llama earrings from Etsy.<br><br>

Her translucent skin belies structural fragility but reveals her prioritiesâ€”she's easily irritated and doesn't much care for food. She feels adequate at many things (history, literature, music), dreadful at some (math, chemistry), and superior in none. Her internal universe is confusing and neurotic (she wonders if anyone will ever find her spectacular, she wonders if her independence is a facade for unrelatability and emptiness), and so she prefers stability in her surroundingsâ€”lemon yellow, eggshell white, desk plants and 96-point Futura stability.<br><br>

She crops her hair short and straight and plain to avoid attention from men and women alike. She knows she's three short steps from stunning but prefers a look independent of mainstream beauty. She dreams of a young James Dean but thinks more fondly of Dwight Schrute. She loves her nuclear family and has exactly two best friends whom she talks to four times a yearâ€”once on her birthday, twice on each of their birthdays, and Christmas.
