<h1>Banalities</h1>
    
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once upon a time, there lived in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a girl called Maddie; she was fabulously rich, strikingly average, and moderately complacent; one day she abandoned her friends for the possibility of a similarly average boyfriend; she was loved by one, lost her love to another; and her life progressed in mundane continuation.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the whole story and we might have left it there at that had there not been points to be earned and words to be graded (despite its inherent subjectivity); there is, in fact, no pleasure in telling this tale, as a reader might guess, for not only is the plot dull to the point of willful death, but there seeps a sardonic, bitter tone, a sentiment known to all melancholic teenage girls, boiling over the edge with angst, masochistically isolated, who’ve encountered their inane female counterparts to their ego-driven self-induced ostensibly “misunderstood” psyches. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(You are free to leave at any point. My only wish is to be allowed to catalog this story.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maddie was not one of these girls. Her name is classically feminine name, second in popularity to Emily, given to girls born in the year two thousand and one. And this, in fact, is most befitting as a title for this almost-woman, Maddie Johnson, seventeen-years-young. And why is this so? Behold, reader, the most average, consistently inconsistent, predictable mold of a teenage girl to have ever existed. In Maddie Johnson’s mind was there little substance; paradoxically, the stark averageness of her psyche was indeed what beheld her as unique.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Johnson family of sixteen Wolman Drive perfectly conformed to government-certified statistics of the American household, as conducted by the US Census Bureau in the year two-thousand and twelve. They had a white picket fence (<i>WPF</i>) that blinded passersby on summer days, and a literal two point five children—Inferior Sister, who only loved to read, and Little Bobby, who had lost all his limbs in a car accident and now hobbled around on his little stub body.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But besides Bobby—whose handicap was used to the Johnsons’ advantage in garnering feigned sympathy and academic scholarships—there was nothing special about Sixteen Wolman Drive. Mr. Johnson was the Chief Financial Officer of a large company and earned a solid six-figures. He was outstandingly typical, with kind brown eyes offset by an unbecoming Anglo-Saxon nose. Mr. Jonson liked the curves of his wife’s body, the way she groomed herself, and how she took baths with authentic Asian-jade salts. His wife, Mrs. Johnson, was born and raised in the quaint suburb of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Mrs. Johnson was an attractive parasite to Mr. Johnson, though neither saw it as such; regardless, she wasted daylight prancing around in nude Spanx, caressing her children’s faces, and cuddling up to her mammoth-like husband (she’s so <i>tiny</i> in comparison!).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maddie, the oldest, was by far the most spoiled child. Having had everything handed to her, she took no interest in knowledge or learning or hobbies that didn’t have to do with perpetuating hyperfemininity, and her cells remained neglected to the fruits of the world. Consequently, her mind—not a flower, not a sponge—wilted and withered.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maddie was in her final year of high school and decided that she needed practice, you know, <i>dating</i> a boy, before she went off to college (which was, in classic pursuit, a local, lowly-ranked state university). Anxious but determined, she imitated her mother’s gestures and gamboled through pallid schoolhalls like an effervescent bunny, garnished in next to nothing, showing off her lackluster countenance stained pink with all her bumbling hopping and frolicking and dabs from the recent line of Sephora’s lemon-scented rose Powderpuff blush.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to no avail. There was no boy Maddie could attract, for it had only been approximately two (<i>seemingly interminable!</i>) weeks and she had made no effort to speak to any masculine soul—only to lustily gaze. Maddie fell into a minor depression that really wasn’t a depression at all because there was not a lack of serotonin in her brain but rather an astounding lack of glial cells, which fortify the neurons in the brain by cementing the myelin sheaths, which insulate the axons, which are the fundamental structures of neurons and, consequently, the building blocks of consciousness.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only other person Maddie talked to was Sara, her best friend since the first grade, except they weren’t actually best friends since the first grade, as all they did in first grade was hit each other with their jean jackets and spurt glue onto each other’s faces out of boredom. But Maddie was rich and Sara was charming, so Sara took it upon herself to form an acquaintanceship with the similarly-attractive Maddie, and they often played with their American Girl Dolls (Sara had but one Native American-themed doll with the ugliest black braids named Standing Water; Maddie had all thirty-four dolls in the collection), and so they made fast friends, but in middle school Sara slept over with the pretty popular girls instead of Maddie even though she promised to sleep over, so Maddie had to watch <i>The Breakfast Club</i> all by her lonesome chocolate-engorged self, and she didn’t even really like the movie, though she did identify with Claire, and she was only watching it because Sara had wanted to, but Sara had only wanted to because flaxen-haired James Carlton had offhandedly said it was his favorite movie, and pretty-boy flaxen-haired James Carlton was the cutest boy on the soccer team, and his opinion was valued far more than those of the unfortunately painted sort.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One boy, though, had unknowingly burrowed his way into Maddie’s heart. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chad Stravinsky was in a peculiar situation. He was not the star quarterback of the football team but rather a mere running back. He was not the star drummer of the drumline but rather a mere cymbalist. He wasn’t even in a recognized role in the high school’s rendition of <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>; appearing in a single scene, playing a single role in the chorus, he only earned the part of a fat, tap-dancing spoon. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maddie subconsciously understood that Chad was always <i>next</i> to the spotlight, never in, and in her duly-noted averageness she’d accepted that she’d never get the quarterback or the guitarist or the Beast but rather the cast-aside second banana.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, <i>O, woe!</i>, Chad and Maddie didn’t even have a class together! She only knew of him through friends of friends of elder brother’s of younger friends, and the only reason she liked him (consciously) was because he was <i>hot</i>, but he wasn’t even <i>that</i> hot because he had acne on his cheeks and flimsy hay hair and chubby thighs, and <i>no one</i> likes chub on a man’s thighs. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sara, tired of hearing Maddie’s whines about involuntary celibacy, decided to have a party where she’d gather <i>all three of her friends</i> on a Friday night for a drunken shindig whereupon Maddie would sight Chad and Chad would sight Maddie they’d fall madly in love and leave Sara, <i>finally</i>, alone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as Maddie arrived at Sara’s house, Sara attacked her. Not in a violent way, but rather in the feigned-teenage-girl-affection way: loud squeals and crushing hugs. There really wasn’t a logical reason for this level of attachment when they had seen each other the day before, so we must conclude that the squeezing was for attention, all for male attention, as their feminine caresses were calculated enough to appear as fairy dust to dumb male socialites. We might even think what the girls did was ingenious, really, in a certain light . . . no, no, I won’t stoop that low. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maddie and Sara embraced and embraced and embraced and the reader might note that this story should end here but the banalities will continue until all our brains have atrophied. But we shall persist. <i>Onwards!</i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chad splayed across the couch, drinking a chilled Dr. Pepper, slowly dissolving all healthy bacteria in his small intestine, discussing with a friend (<i>Sara’s</i> hopeful lover) the upcoming school concert.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>A concert</i>? In his youth, Chad had realized his intrinsic inferiority, so he took it upon himself to learn how to pluck the guitar, and in fingering the strings he garnered the attention of many other vapid girls, for any male who has any hint of any semblance of any shred of real raw emotion is the <i>perfect boy</i>, as music and singing are the only skills necessary to pollinate the female population. To put it simply: music is the best way to get girls.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sara giggled and subtly pointed to Chad’s position on the couch, winking to Maddie, “Hey, you should put your head on his shoulder or something. He’s just sitting there all lonely and, you know, he might want some company or something!”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Oh,” Maddie blushed, “it’s really just the four of us?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes! For Sara was far more cunning than Maddie, and she had set her sights on Chad’s friend and invited only Chad and his friend and Maddie over so they could have a four-person party. Maddie smiled and was glad.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girls sat next to the boys. Now, dear reader, you might be glad in knowing that this part of the story (with its conversational monotony and inexcusable banalities) will be skipped entirely, as there is absolutely nothing to be gleaned from their ilk. Lucky you!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, as the shadows grew long and the night grew brisk, Maddie slid closer and closer to the enigmatic, sensitive Chad, and they’d ended up kissing on the floor of Sara’s house (there may or may not have been sorts of intoxicable fluids permeating their blood). How darling. Sara ended up hating the boy she’d intentionally set herself up with, as he was stupid and boring and had the darting gaze of a weasel. Maddie and Chad left the house as boyfriend and girlfriend, and Sara left the basement disappointed that only part of her plan worked. How miserable indeed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well that was a lovely summary.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Maddie was finally swimming in love. Her thoughts were permeated with images of Chad’s chubby countenance, all thin lips and ruddy cheeks and sparkling blue eyes. She could not concentrate on anything—not her homework, not her clothing, not even the girl who had set the two of them up. The early stages of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder barraged her brain and destroyed probably half its cells (which weren’t being used for much anyway), but her lust did not proceed without some sort of consequence.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sara was mad. Sara was really, really mad. She’d taken all the time and trouble of setting up a wonderful lovely perfect party for not only her benefit but also for her friend’s—and this girl was not prone to altruism. And what did Maddie do? She frolicked off into Chad’s bulbous arms, matched with Maddie’s bulbousness, and they slobbered over each other’s faces like rabid bull dogs, tongues lolling on chins and cheeks indiscriminately. And <i>she</i>, the sole initiator of this contact, was cast aside, <i>she</i>, the loyal best friend, <i>she</i>, superior in appearance yet somehow still involuntarily celibate. Sara, distraught with anger, sexual frustration, and rampant jealousy, was mad.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vapid, vain-hearted Maddie did nothing to help. She means, like, it was <i>her</i> turn to have a boyfriend, not <i>Sara’s</i>, so there wasn’t really anything to be <i>done</i> over this not-so-situation “situation.” It wasn’t fair to ask Madie to occupy herself with Sara’s issue and <i>her</i> nonexistence lovelife. Eyeliner-clad Sara decided to reject all contact with Maddie. Conversations went something like this:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Hey Sara!”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“. . .”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“So, Chad and I did the <i>craziest</i> thing this weekend. So you know how he’s been growing out his facial hair? Well, we were in his room making out for a really, <i>really</i> long time, and—you see these scars under my lip? It’s crazy, I know, but we made out for <i>so long</i> that his stubble scratched my mouth and now it’s bleeding like crazy! Hee hee! Isn’t that crazy?”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“. . .”<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so it went. Maddie gushed and Sara ignored.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Incidentally, Maddie wasn’t exaggerating. The patch of skin below her mouth was truly bloody, as she and Chad made out for <i>seven hours</i>, which, <i>my god</i>, has to be a record, and he came out of the event buzzed and sexually sated, and Maddie came out of it with that awful face, as raw ground beef. But she held her pallor with pride. It seems an impossibility that one would make out for <i>so long</i> that skin might appear as if it was rubbed with a cheese grater, but they were both lonely and aroused in their mutually-assured insipidity that neither found it a problem when the blood seeped into their mouths and made their kisses not sweet but metallic.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this is getting to be <i>much</i> too long for anyone’s tastes, so let’s get straight to the point. Maddie was happy and in love. Sara was jealous. In the end, after a series of nothing and nothing nothings, nothing happened, and they ended up right back in content equilibrium. Chad left for Mankato State, and Maddie for the University of Minnesota. They said they’d stay together, but they eventually broke up. How sad. Maddie left him happy and wiser than before (which is not, in fact, to say wise at all. Not at all wise. Do not think she became so). Chad ended up joining a frat and picking up the deplorable habit of inhaling marijuana (<i>weed, ganja, reefer,</i> what have you). Alas, his case came to a pitiful end after the Bong Incident in which his asthma was irritated by the THC in the marijuana, and his inhaler was not on his person at the time, so he ended up suffocating on the smoke he inhaled and dying during a frat party. How pitiful these banalities are.
